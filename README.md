The aim of the project is to develop a human activity recognition software program. The product is targeted at individual customers. User can signup for an account and store some personal and contact information. This information will be used to calculate different threshold value for each specific user for fall detection. Since the scope of this project does not comprise of real hardware sensors, the human activity data used to simulate and test the fall detecting algorithm is acquire from SISTEMIC lab (http://sistemic.udea.edu.co/en/). In case of a fall being detected, a warning email message will be sent to medical service and also relative of user. At the same time, alarm sound will be played to notify nearby people as well. User also has the option to cancel the alert before an email is sent in case of false alarm.
